        <p>Getting your period is a pain — especially when you're unprepared. Have you been at the gym or coffee shop when that “time of the month” hits and you don't have any supplies on hand? Don’t panic — Spotting! is here to get you the help you need.</p>
        <p>Spotting! is a location-based application that lets users ask other people in their area for menstrual hygiene products. You can submit requests to let nearby Spotters know you need a helping hand, or you can check the map to see if there's anyone you can assist.</p>
        <p>Periods are a pain, so let's work together to make them hurt a little less.</p>
